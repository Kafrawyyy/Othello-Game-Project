# 🎮 Othello Board Game Project

Welcome to our **Othello Board Game** project! This repository contains the implementation of the classic strategy board game Othello, where you can play against a computer opponent powered by the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm.

## 🚀 **Project Overview**

Our project features:
- **Human vs. Computer Mode**: Challenge the AI and test your strategic skills.
- **Alpha-Beta Pruning Algorithm**: Efficient decision-making for the computer player.
- **Multiple Difficulty Levels**: Choose from Easy, Medium, or Hard difficulty, each with different search depths.

## 📋 **How to Play**

1. **Setup**: The game starts with a 4-piece setup in the center of the board—two black and two white disks.
2. **Objective**: Outflank your opponent’s disks by trapping them between two of your own. The disks you capture will flip to your color.
3. **Winning**: The game ends when no more moves are possible, and the player with the majority of disks in their color wins.

## 🔍 **Features**

- **Game Controller**: Manages player turns, handles moves, updates the board, and declares the winner.
- **Intelligent AI**: Implements the Alpha-Beta Pruning algorithm to make strategic decisions.
- **Dynamic Difficulty**: The AI adjusts its depth of search based on the chosen difficulty level:
  - Easy: Depth 1
  - Medium: Depth 3
  - Hard: Depth 5

## 🌟 **Bonus Features**

- **User Interface**: An intuitive GUI that enhances the gameplay experience.
